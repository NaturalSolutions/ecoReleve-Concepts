{"name":"ecoReleve Concepts","tagline":"KOS editor for ecoRelevé project","body":"ecoRelevé Concepts\r\n==================\r\n\r\n![ecoReleve-Concepts](https://raw.github.com/NaturalSolutions/ecoReleve-Concepts/master/Logo/LogosConcepts.png)\r\n\r\n**ecoRelevé Concepts** is an editor of Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) for the ecoRelevé project.\r\n\r\nKOS includes all types of schemas for organizing information and promoting knowledge management, i.e. glossaries, taxonomies, thesauri, ontologies.\r\n\r\nTo address the issue of knowledge management multi-language, multi-site, multi-application, we propose to build a Knowledge Organization System that will be part of the ecoRelevé platform as the Concepts module.\r\nBy using SKOS, a standard for modeling controlled vocabularies, we aim vocabularies to be interoperable applications but also with other external vocabularies.\r\n\r\nWe propose to make the implementation of the Concepts module as an instance of a [Semantic MediaWiki](http://semantic-mediawiki.org/). SMW can be used for managing SKOS vocabularies across the Web (import/export/creation/modification functionalities). A single web-based application will avoid to take care about keeping distant sites up to date.\r\nHighly customizable, SMW will be fully integrated to the ecoRelevé platform.\r\n\r\nThe revision control system, embedded in MediaWiki, will allow a perfect control of the versioning management. Moreover, MediaWiki offers an advanced mechanism of role and right management. This mechanism enables to fully privatize access to the content (login/password).\r\nAs SMW is free and open source, working with it benefits from a large community of developers.\r\n\r\nAnd the last advantage, but not least, of using SMW to implement the ecoRelevé Concepts module concerns the fully integration of this platform into the Semantic Web which is announced to be the future of the current Web by the creator of the Web himself (Tim Berners-Lee).\r\n\r\necoRelevé Concepts is built as an extension of Semantic Mediawiki and it uses Simple Knowledge Organization Systems (SKOS) as standard to model controlled vocabularies.  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
